My brother in law took more than 6 months off when he had his first kid and combined him and his wife were off work for more than a year and a half. \nThe first point to clarify is what the leave is and what benefits you can claim.The leave of absence is the time that a parent can take off work. In Canada, parental leaves are ususally defined at the provincial level and they are unpaid. That means that every province has a different length and slightly different rules.Ontario parental leave is regulated by the ESA (Employment Standards Act) which allows any parent the right to take unpaid parental leave up to 37 weeks. This act protects the new parent’s job, it states that the parent has the right to participate in company’s benefits, to accrue vacations and seniority while on leave.\nWhile you are on leave though, you can claim Employment Insurance (EI) parental benefits. These are defined at federal level and there are 2 options. This is an important aspect to keep in mind because it’s the first decision that new parents need to make, and it’s one of the few details that can’t be modified once a decision is made. This mainly affects how much and for how long you will get EI benefits.\nThe leave is divided as follow:\n\nMaternity leave: it’s reserved to the biological or surrogate mother and can be started 12 weeks before the expected date and up to 17 weeks after childbirth. In this period, the mother can claim EI Maternity benefits. \nParental leave, which is offered in 2 options:    \nStandard parental benefits, which can be claimed within a 52 week period after childbirth up to 35 weeks;\nExtended parental benefits, which can be claimed within a 78 week period after childbirth up to 61 weeks.\n\n\n\nThe compensation is reasonable from my personal point of view: 55% of your salary or $547 a week (this value changes each year, this is what we got in early 2018), whichever is lower. I am not going to do the math because I am not sure how these amounts are taxed, but pretty much if your salary is more than 50k a year you are guaranteed to be capped. This is valid if you choose the standard option, if your choice is the extended one than you are maxed at 33% of your salary (or $328 weekly). Maternity leave is always paid at 55%, the difference is for parental leave only. Some companies offer to top-up maternity leave or parental leave, or both.For simplicity, I would mostly discuss the standard option, which is the one my wife and I picked.\n\nBefore I go any further, let’s state this again: there are 2 main components involved, leave of absence and benefits.The government doesn’t need to know in advance who and when will claim the benefits as long as the total claimed doesn’t go over 35 weeks. There are no restrictions on who can claim the parental benefit, and both parents can also claim it at the same time. From my understanding though, you can’t switch back and forth between parents indefinitely, so before planning elaborate plans that see a parent going back and forth between work and leave every other week, I would consult a Service Canada location.\n\nOur plan is pretty simple: Niki would claim the first 4 months or so (15 weeks of maternity leave and a couple of weeks for parental leave), then we would be off together and have the option to switch who can claim. Niki’s benefit is below the threshold so it would make more sense for me to claim it when I’m off.So we will claim benefits together but Niki will have to stop earlier so that I can keep claiming up to the end of my leave and still remain within the 35 weeks. \nSo when you are planning your leave, keep this in mind: you can take more time off than just what the EI benifts are covering. If we max all the leaves under the standard option for both parents, we would have: 17 week maternity leave  plus 35 week of parental leave for the mother and 37 weeks of parental leave for the father. The sum is 89 weeks divided between the 2 parents. Again, you can claim EI benefits only for 50 of these weeks, whenever is better for you within the limits and restrictions.\nWe also need to consider that parental leave for fathers is not as common yet as it should be, some dads and some companies don’t even know they have this option. I am lucky because I work in a company that highly values family time.\nWhich is more important then, your career or time with your family?

<p>I was already aware that Canada and Ontario have a neat policy around parental leave. My brother in law took more than 6 months off when he had his first kid and combined him and his wife were off work for more than a year and a half. </p>
