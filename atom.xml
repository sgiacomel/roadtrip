    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- excerpt -->Planning a roadtrip around North America is something that I had in mind since I moved to Canada in 2010.<br>Canada has good policies around <a href="/2018/05/20/Parental-leave/" title="Parental leave">Parental leave</a>, which I am going to benefit from.<br>My wife and I decided we were going to spend this leave roadtripping around North America (mainly Canada probably).<br>The reason why we opted for a roadtrip is also because we have a dog, Darwin, who is often left home when we go travel. This time we were keen to have him onboard too.<br>To be completely honest, we didn’t prepare much before our daughter was born, which was at the end of January. Both Niki and I are the type of people that can’t really plan too much in advance. So all the preparations for this trip happened after Cassandra was born.<br>In February I started working on this website, which is mainly a mean of updating people where we are and what we are doing. Since I love maps, I decided I was going to keep track of our position using a normal gps phone. I wrote a quick javascript script to map the captured coordinates on google maps. You can see some tests from if you scroll back in time on the home page.<br>Looking for a vehicle proved to be probably the most stressful and difficult part of the preparation. We focused our search on <a href="/2018/06/07/Roadtrek/" title="Roadtrek">Roadtrek</a>, which I quickly realized are sold very fast. We bought ours from this guy: <a href="https://www.bassoautosales.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basso Auto Sales</a><br>At the end of May we moved our stuff to my father in law’s (thanks Al) and we are now ready to take off.<br>The plan is to head east to Newfoundland through Quebec, New Brunswick, PEI and Nova Scotia. On the way back, we might go through the States. Then we head west.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Parental leave</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- excerpt -->When my wife and I were planning on having our first kid, one of the first thoughts that crossed my mind was: time off.</p><div class="figure fig-50 right nocaption" style="width:;"><a class="fancybox" href="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647664/Parental/1.jpg" title="" data-caption="" data-fancybox="parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="fig-img" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647664/Parental/1.jpg" alt=""></a></div><p>I was already aware that Canada and Ontario have a neat policy around parental leave. My brother in law took more than 6 months off when he had his first kid and combined him and his wife were off work for more than a year and a half. </p><p>The first point to clarify is what the leave is and what benefits you can claim.<br>The <strong>leave of absence</strong> is the time that a parent can take off work. In Canada, parental leaves are ususally defined at the provincial level and they are unpaid. That means that every province has a different length and slightly different rules.<br>Ontario parental leave is regulated by the ESA (Employment Standards Act) which allows any parent the right to take unpaid parental leave up to 37 weeks. This act protects the new parent’s job, it states that the parent has the right to participate in company’s benefits, to accrue vacations and seniority while on leave.</p><p>While you are on leave though, you can claim Employment Insurance (EI) <strong>parental benefits</strong>. These are defined at federal level and there are 2 options. This is an important aspect to keep in mind because it’s the first decision that new parents need to make, and it’s one of the few details that can’t be modified once a decision is made. This mainly affects how much and for how long you will get EI benefits.</p><p>The leave is divided as follow:</p><ul><li>Maternity leave: it’s reserved to the biological or surrogate mother and can be started 12 weeks before the expected date and up to 17 weeks after childbirth. In this period, the mother can claim EI Maternity benefits. </li><li>Parental leave, which is offered in 2 options:    <ul><li>Standard parental benefits, which can be claimed within a 52 week period after childbirth up to 35 weeks;</li><li>Extended parental benefits, which can be claimed within a 78 week period after childbirth up to 61 weeks.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The compensation is reasonable from my personal point of view: 55% of your salary or $547 a week (this value changes each year, this is what we got in early 2018), whichever is lower. I am not going to do the math because I am not sure how these amounts are taxed, but pretty much if your salary is more than 50k a year you are guaranteed to be capped. This is valid if you choose the standard option, if your choice is the extended one than you are maxed at 33% of your salary (or $328 weekly). Maternity leave is always paid at 55%, the difference is for parental leave only. Some companies offer to top-up maternity leave or parental leave, or both.<br>For simplicity, I would mostly discuss the standard option, which is the one my wife and I picked.</p><div class="figure fig-33 left nocaption" style="width:;"><a class="fancybox" href="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647665/Parental/2.jpg" title="" data-caption="" data-fancybox="parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="fig-img" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647665/Parental/2.jpg" alt=""></a></div><div class="figure fig-33 left nocaption" style="width:;"><a class="fancybox" href="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647665/Parental/3.jpg" title="" data-caption="" data-fancybox="parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="fig-img" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647665/Parental/3.jpg" alt=""></a></div><div class="figure fig-33 right nocaption" style="width:;"><a class="fancybox" href="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647666/Parental/4.jpg" title="" data-caption="" data-fancybox="parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="fig-img" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647666/Parental/4.jpg" alt=""></a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>Before I go any further, let’s state this again: there are 2 main components involved, leave of absence and benefits.<br>The government doesn’t need to know in advance who and when will claim the benefits as long as the total claimed doesn’t go over 35 weeks. There are no restrictions on who can claim the parental benefit, and both parents can also claim it at the same time. From my understanding though, you can’t switch back and forth between parents indefinitely, so before planning elaborate plans that see a parent going back and forth between work and leave every other week, I would consult a Service Canada location.</p><div class="figure fig-33 right nocaption" style="width:;"><a class="fancybox" href="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647662/Parental/0.jpg" title="" data-caption="" data-fancybox="parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="fig-img" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sgiacomel/image/upload/a_exif/v1525647662/Parental/0.jpg" alt=""></a></div><p>Our plan is pretty simple: Niki would claim the first 4 months or so (15 weeks of maternity leave and a couple of weeks for parental leave), then we would be off together and have the option to switch who can claim. Niki’s benefit is below the threshold so it would make more sense for me to claim it when I’m off.<br>So we will claim benefits together but Niki will have to stop earlier so that I can keep claiming up to the end of my leave and still remain within the 35 weeks. </p><p>So when you are planning your leave, keep this in mind: you can take more time off than just what the EI benifts are covering. If we max all the leaves under the standard option for both parents, we would have: 17 week maternity leave  plus 35 week of parental leave for the mother and 37 weeks of parental leave for the father. The sum is 89 weeks divided between the 2 parents. Again, you can claim EI benefits only for 50 of these weeks, whenever is better for you within the limits and restrictions.</p><p>We also need to consider that parental leave for fathers is not as common yet as it should be, some dads and some companies don’t even know they have this option. I am lucky because I work in a company that highly values family time.</p><p>How often do you get to spend time with your family?</p>]]></content>
